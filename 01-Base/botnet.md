# botnet

A botnet is a number of Internet-connected devices, each of which is running one or more bots. 

Botnets can be used to perform distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack), steal data, send spam, and allows the attacker to access the device and its connection. 

The owner can control the botnet using command and control (C&C) software. The word "botnet" is a combination of the words "robot" and "network".
